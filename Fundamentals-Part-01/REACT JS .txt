Q)iimp question difference between REAL DOM AND VIRTUAL DOM
VIRTUAL DOM
1.NO MEMORY WASTAGE.
2.FAST UPDATES.
3.DOM MANIPULALTION IS CHEAP.
4.CANT DIRECLTY TARGET HTML.

REAL DOM
1.MORE MEMORY WASTAGE.
2.SLOW UPDATES.
3.DOM MANIPULATION IS expensive. 
4.WE CAN DIRECTLY TARGET HTML.

Q)DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANGULAR JS AND REACT JS 

REACT JS
1.REACT JS BELONG S TO FACEBOOK
2.WE ARE USING JAVASCRIPT
3.REACT JS IS UNIDIRECTIONAL OR ONE WAY BINDING 
4.REACTJS IS LIBRARY
5.IN REACTJS THEY ARE USING VIRTUAL DOM



ANGULAR JS
1.ANGULAR JS BELONGS TO GOOGLE
2.TYPE SCRIPT
3.IT IS BIDIRECTIONAL OR TWO WAY BINDING.
4.ANGULLAR JS IS FRAMEWORK
5.IN ANGULAR JS THEY ARE USING REAL DOM

to install react (code for terminal of vs code) first install node js and check installed onn cmd 
==>

Q)Difference between jsx and without jsx ?
==> 
WITH JSX==>

function App(){
return(
	<div>
		<h1>Hello</h1>
	</div>
	)
}




WITHOUT JSX==>
function App(){
return(
	React.createElement(div.{},<h1>Hello</h1>)
	)
}

1.componnents are liks js function
2.every componenet must start with uppercase because react treats the componenets as DOM elements.
3.Components are reusable .


functional component
1.Easy
2.Js function
3.Hooks are present
4.absent
5.absent

class component
1.Difficult
2.js oops
3.absent
4.lifecycle method is present
5.Scope,member,constructor,this present

*****************PROPS**************
1.props is like a property passing from parent component to child component
2.passing as like a functional argument 
3.props is read only


*********************************************************************************************************************

props
1.read only.
2.passing from parent to child.


state
1.we can modify.
2.writting in same component.

HOOKS
1.HOOKS are the feature introduced in react 16.8 version.
2.Before react hooks we are unable to use state and lifecycle method inn functional components adn that is the reason functional components were called stateless.

Rules to foollow while using hoooks
1.Hooks should always be called at top level.
2.we can only call hooks from functional component

Hooks
1.use state ==>
	1.It allows you to add state to the functional component
	2.use state which helps to track and manipulate the state.
	eg:
		const[count,setCount]=useState(0)

		return(
			<button onClick{()=>setCount(count+1)}>+</button>
			
		)
2.use effect
	1.useEffect is a sideEffect for the use state.
	2.common use cases for user 
		1.data fetching
		2.DOM manipulation 
		3.Timers and intervals
		4.addEventListener

	1.if the dedpendancy array is empty the effect will run onlu once ,after the initial render .
	2. if the dependancy array is not provided the effect will run after the every render of the component.
	3.if the dependancy array contains a variable the effect will only be re-executed when any of those variable changes

3.use layout effect==>
	1.use LayoutEffect is a version of use Effect 
	2.files that executes before the browser refresh the page
	3.
4.use memo==>
	1.useMemo returns memoized value.
	2.The useMemo Hook only runs when one of its dependancies updated.
	3.This can improve performance.

Q]Difference between useMemo and useCallBack
==>

5.use call back==>
	1the react use callBack hook returns a memorised callBack function.
	2.The use caaBack hook only runs when one of its dependancies updated.
	3.This can improve performance.

6.use ref==>
	1.useRef which helps to target reference object and which helps to target dom elements by the help of .current property.
7.use content
8.use id
9.use param  
10.use navigate

memoization==>which helps to optimeze expensive calculation.


Q] why useEffect is renedaring two times?







useContext==>
1.context provide a way to share data between componenets without having props .
2.useContext manages states globally
3.it can be used together with the useState .
4.we are passing data from parent component to nested child component , this is called "props drilling".
